Stock Market Analysis

In this first part of this stock market analysis, I used pandas to get many stocks information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally 
a roughly risk predicition of stocks based on their previous performance history. In the second part of this project, I will use different
time series models (e.g., ARIMA) to predict stocks performance.
