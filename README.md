# Stock Market Analysis

In this first part of the stock market analysis, I used pandas to get many stocks information from search engines, visualize the different attributes of it, and finally a roughly risk prediction of stocks based on their previous performance history. I used one dimensional **random walk model** to simulate the dynamics of the market using **Monte Carlo simulation** using the parameters extracted from the data. In the second part of this project, I will use different time series models (e.g., **ARIMA**) to predict stocks performance and will compare with the random walk model.
